# ClearClaim AI

**Fixing delayed and stopped public benefits with clarity, not complexity.**

ClearClaim AI is a task-driven public service resolution platform that helps Indian citizens understand **why pensions, insurance claims, scholarships, or subsidies get delayed or stopped** and guides them with **clear, actionable steps to resolve the issue in a single visit**.

This is **not a chatbot-first product**.  
AI works silently in the background to support structured workflows that prioritize **resolution over information browsing**.

## The Problem

Crores of Indians depend on public benefit systems. When a benefit stops or gets delayed:

- Reasons are unclear or poorly communicated  
- Citizens are sent across offices multiple times  
- Each visit costs 2–5 hours and often 1–3 full workdays  
- Elderly citizens and daily wage workers are hit the hardest  

Existing portals only show:
> Status: Pending / Rejected

They don’t answer the real question:
> Why did my benefit stop, and what exactly do I do next?

## The Solution

ClearClaim AI provides **clear explanations and a fix plan**, not generic scheme details.

Users:
1. Select their issue (Pension, Insurance, Scholarship, Subsidy)
2. Upload a notice or explain the problem using voice or text
3. Receive a plain-language explanation of the issue
4. Get a step-by-step resolution plan:
   - Office to visit  
   - Counter or department  
   - Documents to carry  
   - What to say  

The goal is **resolution in one visit**.
